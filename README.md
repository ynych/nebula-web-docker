# Nebula Graph Studio

Nebula Graph Studio (Studio for short) is a web-based visualization tool for Nebula Graph. With Studio, you can create a graph schema, import data, edit nGQL statements for data queries, and explore graphs in one stop.

## Start Docker-based Studio

To start Docker-based Studio for Nebula Graph v1.x or v2.x, run these commands:

1. Clone the `nebula-web-docker` repo.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-web-docker.git
    ```

2. Change the directory:
   - For Nebula Graph v2.0 GA, run `cd nebula-web-docker/v2`.
   - For Nebula Graph V2.0-rc，Please：
   ```shell
    $ cd nebula-web-docker/v2
    $ vim ./nebula-docker-compose
    ...
        web:
            image: vesoft/nebula-graph-studio:v2-rc // modify v2 to v2-rc
    ...
   ```
   - For Nebula Graph v1.x, run `cd nebula-web-docker`.

3. Pull the docker image of Studio.

    ```bash
    docker-compose pull
    ```

4. Build and start Docker-based Studio. `-d` is specified to run the containers in the background.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  
    If these lines return, Docker-based Studio is deployed and started.

    ```bash
    Creating docker_importer_1 ... done
    Creating docker_client_1   ... done
    Creating docker_web_1      ... done
    Creating docker_nginx_1    ... done
    ```

On Chrome, enter `localhost:7001` to get access to Studio. When a page as follows appears, Studio starts successfully.
